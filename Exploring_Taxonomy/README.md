Using the kraken-biom program and all the files with the ".report" extension obtained through Kraken,we created a table in the BIOM format, which we named "cuatroc.biom".
This table will contain the taxonomic abundances for each sample, with rows representing taxa and columns representing samples.
We use the ".report" files generated by Kraken because they contain the taxonomic assignments and abundance information for each sample.

Finally, we obtained the cuatrom.biom alpha diversity chart, beta diversity chart, absolute abundance plot, and relative abundance plot.
