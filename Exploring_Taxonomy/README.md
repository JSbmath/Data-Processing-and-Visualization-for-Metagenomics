Using the kraken-biom program and all the files with the ".report" extension obtained through Kraken,we created a table in the BIOM format, which we named "cuatroc.biom".
This table will contain the taxonomic abundances for each sample, with rows representing taxa and columns representing samples.
We use the ".report" files generated by Kraken because they contain the taxonomic assignments and abundance information for each sample.

Finally, we obtained the cuatrom.biom alpha diversity chart, beta diversity chart, absolute abundance plot, and relative abundance plot.

Regarding the alpha diversity plots (Observed, Chao1, and Shannon):

*   The number of observed OTUs (Observed) varies widely among the samples, from less than 2000 to more than 8000. This suggests substantial variation in species richness across the samples.
    
*   The Chao1 index values follow a similar pattern to the observed OTUs but are consistently higher. This is expected, as Chao1 estimates the total species richness, including unobserved species, giving more weight to singletons and doubletons.
    
*   The Shannon index shows less variation among the samples compared to Observed and Chao1. The values range from approximately 2 to 4, suggesting moderate differences in species abundance evenness across the samples.


In the NMDS plot showing the beta diversity of our samples, the points are distributed throughout the NMDS space, suggesting considerable variation in species composition among the samples. However, some clustering or gradient formation is also observed, with several points located very close to each other, particularly near the origin (0,0). This indicates that some samples have a fairly similar species composition.

In the absolute abundance plot, we can see that Acidobacteria appears to be the most abundant phylum in the sample, closely followed by Deferribacteres.

On the other hand, in the relative abundance plot, we can see that Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes are the dominant phyla, each constituting around 30-35% of the bacterial community.
