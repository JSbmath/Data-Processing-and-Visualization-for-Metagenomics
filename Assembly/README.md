After applying Trimmomatic, two programs were used for the assembly process: MetaSPAdes and MEGAHIT.
MetaSPAdes was only used for single-end reads since we had few of them. On the other hand, we opted to use MEGAHIT for paired-end reads because there were many more of them, and MetaSPAdes requires a lot of processing power for assembly (which we did not have at the moment).
